## Teaching Resources

### <u>Insects in the classroom webinar</u>
<i>Published 17 November 2020 on <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2998-all-about-insects">Science Learning Hub</a></i>

Check out this recording of a webinar presented by Dr Chrissie Painting and myself about how teachers can use insect-related resources and activities to support learning inside the classroom and outside. We give a brief introduction to the insect world, talk about why it’s important to learn about insects, and we provide some examples of how insects are a good fit for certain parts of the New Zealand school curriculum.

### <u>Buzz in the Garden Activities</u>
<i>Published 21 October 2020 on Science Learning Hub</i>

A set of three outside activities where children observe insects to answer questions about the natural world. These resources were created in partnership with <a href="https://morganemerien.com/">Morgane Merien</a>, <a href="https://leilani-walker.com/">Leilani Walker</a>, and <a href="https://chrissiepainting.com/">Chrissie Painting</a> as part of the Curious Minds ‘Buzz in the Garden’ project:

* <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2982-pollinator-counts-insects-and-flowers">Pollinator counts</a>: students directly observe pollinators on flowering plants and record their observational data on an activity sheet.
* <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2980-pitfall-traps-monitoring-ground-dwelling-insects">Pitfall traps</a>: students place pitfall traps in various locations around the school, check the traps daily and record their observations.
* <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2981-yellow-pan-traps-monitoring-flying-insects">Pan traps</a>: students monitor flying insects by using yellow and black containers and record their observational data on an activity sheet.

### <u>Taxonomy — the science of species discovery</u>
<i>Published 8 October 2019 on <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2829-taxonomy-the-science-of-species-discovery">Science Learning Hub</a></i>

Taxonomy is the scientific discipline dedicated to describing, classifying, and interpreting biodiversity. In this article, I explain what it is, how it works, and why it is so important for the economy, for the other sciences, and for understanding our place in the world.

### <u>Parasitoid wasp life cycle</u>
<i>Published 24 May 2019 on <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2770-parasitoid-wasp-life-cycle">Science Learning Hub</a></i>

An overview of how native New Zealand wasps reproduce by laying their eggs on or inside a host.

### <u>Insect antennae</u>
<i>Published 27 April 2019 on <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2756-insect-antennae">Science Learning Hub</a></i>

An introduction to how insects use their antennae to gather sensory information including smell, touch, temperature, and wind movement. Includes the basic anatomy of antennae, and how scientists might study insect smell in order to lure pests away from crops.
